#### The Holistic Approach

The ALX Foundation Program will equip you with key tools, and critical soft and technical skills. You will also invest your time in discovering who you are, developing your character, forming healthy lifestyle habits, and exploring rewarding ways to merge your professional aspirations and mission. We will empower you to skillfully navigate and confidently lead the different aspects of your day-to-day.

#### The Content: “ALX Secret Sauce”

We have already talked about the secret sauce a few times. This program will unlock your ability to build and practice additional critical real-world skills that are highly sought after by employers and clients. As an ALX Professional Foundations Program grad, you will be self-aware, aligned with your values, a great communicator and collaborator, humble and empathetic, and an analytical and creative thinker. You will be well-equipped for your job search as you will hold insider secrets for successfully finding and creating work opportunities and standing out in job interviews.

#### Peer Support

As part of this program, you will become a member of a community. Within that community, you will belong to a smaller group called a Squad, which consists of other peers who are also going through the program. As Squad members, you will regularly communicate via Circle, offer peer coaching sessions to one another, and support and motivate one another throughout the entire learning journey.

From Squads, smaller teams are formed that collaborate on group projects (in-person or virtually). Many past ALX participants report that the connections made in their Squads and teams were what enabled them to complete the course successfully. These connections are often carried forward and form the foundation of the learners’ professional networks.

#### Real-World Focus and Applied Projects

Unlike traditional courses, all learning content and assignments/milestones are designed to help you develop critical skills that you actually need for the real world of work. Weekly Tests are designed to help you assess whether you have understood the content. Milestones are designed to simulate projects done in the workplace and provide you with actual work samples.

### Secret Sauce: 8 Meta-Skills

Let’s explore the 8 meta-skills further. As you read, think about how you would rate yourself on each one.

[![8 Meta Skills Turbo Charge](content/meta_turbo.png)](content/meta_turbo.png)

As we shared, the AL team conducted research that included interviewing over 200 executives across Africa and around the world to discover the answer to one key question: _“What skills are most important for entry-level employees to have when they work for your company?”_

What resulted from work was a list of 7 “meta-skills” that almost all employers agreed were _essential _to success for young people in today’s modern workplace. These skills are as follows:

#### LEADING SELF

### Take your Skills Inventory

Now that you have an understanding of the program and the skills you will gain over the next weeks, now is a good time for you to step back and conduct a baseline assessment of which skills you think you already have versus the ones you need to work on over the next few months of the program.

We’ve created a [Skills Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15oufNF_xlRJyqWwE3Wzpyf2Xbcm_hF9kUtDG1PU9HVI/edit?usp=drive_link) for you to keep track of your development. You will complete the skills tracker this week and then then again at Week 7 to gauge your progress. This will help you (and us) track your progress in the program. Click on the link and create a copy of the tracking document on your Google Drive.

The next activity will ask you to complete the Skills Tracker. More guidelines are provided there.

It is okay if some of the skills are not familiar. That means you are in the right place to develop them and add them to your can-do list.
