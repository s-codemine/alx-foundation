**There are many programs out there that teach foundational tech skills so why is this program so unique?**

#### The Holistic Approach

The ALX Foundation Program will equip you with key tools, and critical soft and technical skills. You will also invest your time in discovering who you are, developing your character, forming healthy lifestyle habits, and exploring rewarding ways to merge your professional aspirations and mission. We will empower you to skillfully navigate and confidently lead the different aspects of your day-to-day.

#### The Content: “ALX Secret Sauce”

We have already talked about the secret sauce a few times. This program will unlock your ability to build and practice additional critical real-world skills that are highly sought after by employers and clients. As an ALX Professional Foundations Program grad, you will be self-aware, aligned with your values, a great communicator and collaborator, humble and empathetic, and an analytical and creative thinker. You will be well-equipped for your job search as you will hold insider secrets for successfully finding and creating work opportunities and standing out in job interviews.

#### Peer Support

As part of this program, you will become a member of a community. Within that community, you will belong to a smaller group called a Squad, which consists of other peers who are also going through the program. As Squad members, you will regularly communicate via Circle, offer peer coaching sessions to one another, and support and motivate one another throughout the entire learning journey.

From Squads, smaller teams are formed that collaborate on group projects (in-person or virtually). Many past ALX participants report that the connections made in their Squads and teams were what enabled them to complete the course successfully. These connections are often carried forward and form the foundation of the learners’ professional networks.

#### Real-World Focus and Applied Projects

Unlike traditional courses, all learning content and assignments/milestones are designed to help you develop critical skills that you actually need for the real world of work. Weekly Tests are designed to help you assess whether you have understood the content. Milestones are designed to simulate projects done in the workplace and provide you with actual work samples.

### Secret Sauce: 8 Meta-Skills

Let’s explore the 8 meta-skills further. As you read, think about how you would rate yourself on each one.

[![8 Meta Skills Turbo Charge](content/meta_turbo.png)](content/meta_turbo.png)

As we shared, the AL team conducted research that included interviewing over 200 executives across Africa and around the world to discover the answer to one key question: _“What skills are most important for entry-level employees to have when they work for your company?”_

What resulted from work was a list of 7 “meta-skills” that almost all employers agreed were _essential _to success for young people in today’s modern workplace. These skills are as follows:

#### LEADING SELF

Those skilled at leading self see “failure” as a learning opportunity. They pursue their vision even through adversity. They use all of their real-world experience for growth.

> **Key Characteristics**:
>
> + Self-awareness
> + Proactivity
> + Lifelong Values
> + Self-improvement
> + Self-regulation
>

#### LEADING OTHERS

> **Key Characteristics**:
>
> + Empathy
> + Diversity
> + Relationship Building
> + Feedback
> + Collaboration
>

#### ENTREPRENEURIAL THINKING

You don’t have to be an entrepreneur to benefit from entrepreneurial thinking.  People with this mindset pursue their vision even through adversity. They see their real-world experience as an opportunity to learn and grow.

> **Key Characteristics**:
>
> + Systems Thinking
> + Identifying Opportunities
> + Human-Centred Thinking

#### COMMUNICATION FOR IMPACT

Your brilliant ideas will do you no good if you can’t effectively share them with others. A deep understanding of your audience is just as important as what you say and how you say it.

> + Writing Process
> + Voice
> + Organising for Effective Communication
> + Storytelling and Presentation

#### CRITICAL THINKING

Today’s successful professionals don’t jump to conclusions or assume outcomes—they critically examine facts and carefully consider solutions.

>
> + Authentic Inquiry
> + Evidence/Research Analysis
> + Arguments and Judgement
> + Synthesis
>

#### AND…

In addition to the 7 meta-skills above, you will be learning **one extra meta-skill.** We’re throwing in this bonus because as tech professionals, it’s also critical.

Of course, as you venture out into the world to become leaders in technology,specifically, it is also crucial that you have the appropriate tech skills to be able to succeed in your chosen tech tracks and leverage all the tools that are available to today’s modern workforce.

In learning about the tech ecosystem, you will understand:

>
> ✔ How to work in Technical & Product Teams
> ✔ Tech Tools
> ✔ Ethics in Tech
> ✔ Technical Literacy
> ✔ Tech Track Specialization
>

Learning and practicing all of these meta-skills will supercharge your journey as a tech professional!

### Take your Skills Inventory

Now that you have an understanding of the program and the skills you will gain over the next weeks, now is a good time for you to step back and conduct a baseline assessment of which skills you think you already have versus the ones you need to work on over the next few months of the program.

We’ve created a [Skills Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15oufNF_xlRJyqWwE3Wzpyf2Xbcm_hF9kUtDG1PU9HVI/edit?usp=drive_link) for you to keep track of your development. You will complete the skills tracker this week and then then again at Week 7 to gauge your progress. This will help you (and us) track your progress in the program. Click on the link and create a copy of the tracking document on your Google Drive.

The next activity will ask you to complete the Skills Tracker. More guidelines are provided there.

It is okay if some of the skills are not familiar. That means you are in the right place to develop them and add them to your can-do list.

#### YOU are the master of your own ALX journey!

Cultivate curiosity towards new skills, demonstrate proactivity in acquiring them, and take ownership of your own learning experience.Before you know it this T-shirt might just be the right fit for you.

## Program Overview Part 2

### Course Structure

[![Course Structure](content/course_struc.png)](content/course_struc.png)

#### Content, Milestones and Tests

Each week of the program, new learning content is released on Savanna. To successfully complete the Test and the Milestone for that week, you will need to carefully review this content.

During the 8 weeks of this course, you will have 8 required Weekly Tests and 7 required Weekly Milestones (Starting from Week 2). Completing this course is necessary for you to proceed to the second half of the program, where you will begin work in your chosen tech specialization.

This means that **in total, there are 15 required, graded elements over the next 8 weeks of this program**.

+ The Weekly Milestone is a submitted assignment that is automatically and immediately graded on Savanna. You will submit this assignment and then complete the Weekly Test, which assesses your knowledge of the Milestone. You must complete both tasks to pass the Milestone.
+ The Weekly Test is designed to evaluate your understanding based on your Milestone submission. It is also graded automatically and immediately on Savanna. You can reattempt these tests to improve your score. Make sure you’re prepared and attentive when taking these tests.
+ Weekly Tests and Milestones are due every Monday of the program, by no later than 11:59 pm GMT. You must receive a score of 70% or higher on both Tests and Milestones to pass.

A week-by-week program overview was shared at the start of the Week. You can download and view it from this link.

#### City Hubs

Several cities will have ALX Hubs for learners to use. The following activities may be available at city hubs near you:

+ Community and social events including watch parties for office hours, virtual guest speakers, and course videos.
+ Workshops covering specific content topics and learning outcomes.
