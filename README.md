## Why Complete the ALX Professional Foundations Program?

A key driver and motivator that propels people to achieve the unachievable, set new norms, break limits and successfully Do Hard Things is understanding the **WHY**.

### WHY Do We Require This Course (When maybe all you really want is to learn tech skills)?
Employers from across the globe are consistently frustrated with entry-level employees because they commonly lack essential 21st-century skills. Specifically, many people lack the ability to think critically and creatively to solve complex problems, to communicate both in writing and speaking, to manage themselves and their time, and to successfully collaborate with diverse team members to complete projects.

The ALX Professional Foundations course is designed to give you a strong advantage by providing you with “The ALX Special Sauce”– a curated combination of meaningful opportunities to learn, practice, and deepen the knowledge, skill sets, and character qualities that are highly desired by employers, but that are not taught in most tech training programs.

Our Special Sauce consists of the 8 Meta Skills that we listed in our welcome note and will share more about it shortly. We invite you to learn more about the WHY behind these meta-skills. They are discussed in more depth in this <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/defining-the-skills-citizens-will-need-in-the-future-world-of-work?cid=other-soc-lkn-mps-mck-oth-2106--&amp;sid=8452174334&amp;linkId=194255334">research article by McKinsey</a>, which shares what is truly needed to thrive in the future, ever-changing world of work. Let’s pause here, so you can read the article. It will help you get to realize just how important this course is for your future success!

## Using Savanna

Your ALX Professional Foundations course content is all found here, on Savanna. In this tutorial video, we show you around Savanna so you can get comfortable with it. The course material is organized by modules with projects, which you can think of as chapters. Every week, new modules with projects will be unlocked so you can access them. We recommend that you go to “Projects” to view what you have completed and what you have yet to complete. Please go through the material in the order in which it is presented.

Please watch this mandatory tutorial on getting around Savanna. Please note that the course shown in the demo is close but not identical to yours and that any dates and content shown are just examples.

By the end of the video, make sure you can answer YES to these questions:

- Do I know where to go to see the modules and course content?
- Have I understood how to navigate Savanna (for example how to move to the next page)?
- Have I understood how to take a “Check Your Understanding” quiz?
- Have I understood how to take the Weekly Test?

## Karibu Ceremony

**Need to know everything about this exciting journey before going full throttle? We have you covered.**

The ceremony is compulsory and a required part of this program. So make sure you have all the details you need to attend. Keep a lookout for email communications on this matter!

In addition to the Ceremony and content here on Savanna, there are a plethora of orientation activities taking place throughout this week, online and at your nearest City Hub. You are expected to participate. Please take a moment right now to check your inbox for any ALX calendar invitations. Accept the invites, add them to your calendar and make note of what is happening and when.

This is the week to get set up, get ahead and understand what is in store. Missing the Karibu Ceremony and associated onboarding activities this week is not an option. How you start will strongly impact the rest of your journey here at ALX. If you get left behind there’s no Tesla fast enough to catch you up.

## Get to Know Your Course Designers and Guides

There is a HUGE army behind the scenes here. All of us are working to make sure that you and your peers are set up to succeed in this program. Here are some of the course designers you may come across during your journey.



Now that you have an idea of some of the many people working hard for your success, we are wide-eyed and excited to meet you too!

You should now (or very soon) have access to The Portal, a platform where you’ll have a chance to introduce yourself to us, and your peers in your Squad (your assigned peer group… More on that in a little bit).

## End of Module 1.1

What? We see you pulling winning stunts already!
Let’s celebrate this moment - you have just completed your first module in Savanna.
You really are on fire!
Take a short break and treat yourself to a snack.

## Module 2 - About Professional Foundations

### Programme Overview

We have created a program summary so you have an overview of what the next 2 months will entail. If you would like to scan through it you can go through the slides below. You can also download it [here](content/foundations_program.pdf) and keep a copy for yourself if you want.

The overview covers the key skills you will master in the first 2 months. It is a clear guide on what you will learn but please note that the flow of modules and content might move around as the week progresses. This will be to keep the content relevant and applicable to each week’s key takeaways.

Exciting times are ahead and we hope that seeing this overview will help you proactively plan ahead.

## What You Will Learn: 8 Meta Skills

### What are the next few months about and what will you be able to do by the time you’ve completed them?

#### We thought you’d never ask!

We are confident that the skills you will acquire here are gold! We’ve crafted a learning journey that will equip you with holistic skills that are highly sought after, and that most programs do not teach. You can think of these skills as a secret weapon that will:

+ Make you a more attractive job candidate,
+ Increase your job longevity and satisfaction,
+ Boost your confidence in global workspaces, and
+ Advance your professional relevance in tech.

During the earliest days of the African Leadership University, the AL team interviewed over 200 executives across Africa and around the world to discover the answer to one key question: **“What skills are most important for entry-level employees to have when they work for your company?”**

What resulted from this was a list of 7 meta-skills that almost all employers agreed were _essential _to success for young people in today’s modern workplace. In addition to the 7 meta-skills above – due to the rapidly evolving employment and tech landscape – we added one more meta-skill on Tech Ecosystems.

The 8 meta skills are broken down below.

[![8 Meta Skills](content/outline.png)](content/outline.png)

This course will empower you to navigate and appropriately interact in a variety of professional settings. It will increase your intellectual and creative capacity, sharpen your data-driven mindset and critical thinking skills, empower your career path by helping you connect with your personal mission, equip you to better manage yourself and work with others, and enable you to set a high standard of professional excellence.

You have just become part of a network of the continent’s leading talent in tech!

## Tech Onboarding - Personal Toolkit (Savanna & ALX Portal)

The ALX Portal and Savanna are the two main tools you must employ in this course if you want to succeed. This week, setting up and becoming accustomed to each of these tools should be your first priority.

By now, you should have received instructions on how to get started on each of the platforms. Please be sure to carefully follow the instructions provided for each of the tools.

[![ALX Savanna(content/savanna.png)](content/savanna.png)

We have already talked about Savanna (where you are right now!) This is where you will spend most of your time absorbing content and this is where you will submit your practice quizzes and Weekly Tests. This is also the place where you will submit your weekly Milestones and do your peer evaluations.

[![ALX Fellowship Portal](content/portal.png)](content/portal.png)

You will access ALX’s community through The Portal. This is the place where you will communicate with fellow students online and get help from ALX staff when needed. This is also where you will receive announcements, and participate in virtual community activities and discussions. In short, this is your WhatsApp x Insta for the duration of this course!

## Navigating Savanna

[![ALX Savanna(content/savanna.png)](content/savanna.png)

As we mentioned in the Savanna Tutorial Video our course is organized by modules with projects, which you can think of as chapters. Every week, a new set of modules will be unlocked so you can access them. The modules, and the pages within them, are meant to be studied in the order they are presented. There is a natural progression to the material, so it will not be helpful for you to jump around. You can access the projects (and their relate modules) you have to complete from the left navigation bar by clicking the “Projects” icon.

[![ALX Savanna(content/s_1.png)](content/s_1.png)

Clicking on any of the projects will show you the details of how modules and pages are arranged within the course. You can navigate them from the from the secondary navigation bar on the left.

[![ALX Savanna(content/s_2.png)](content/s_2.png)

You can also access your projects from the “My Planning” where you’ll find all your projects and submission requirements in a calendar timeline.

HAPPY SAVANNA EXPLORING!

## Get Set Up on The ALX Portal

You should have received your invite to The ALX Portal where you can access the ALX Professional Foundations Program community. You can also click on <a href="https://member.theroom.com/community" target="_blank">this link to login to The ALX Portal</a>.

The online community space can only be accessed through The ALX Portal. You cannot access it through an Android, Apple or Windows App. For quick alternative access, you can open your space on the portal, bookmark the URL, and save it to your web browser as a favourite or tab on your home screen.

## Set Up Your ALX Portal

### Connectivity

[![Connectivity(content/connectivity.png)](content/connectivity.png)

Working in tech will require consistent and reliable internet connection.

This program is no different and requires the same thing. There are many videos to view, a lot of content to absorb, peer activities to complete, live virtual events to attend, and a requirement to upload milestone assignments and evaluate peers’ assignments on time. Please adequately plan ahead for how you are going to accomplish this.

Some students have purchased additional data plans on their phones, while others have planned on working from a café with Wi-Fi for several hours each day. We understand this can be a challenging problem, but to thrive in this program and the tech sector, internet connectivity will have to be a constant.

We believe in your resourcefulness! As you go through this program, we encourage you to share with your peers how you plan on implementing creative and reliable solutions to consistent and reliable Wi-Fi! And remember, you can always your city hub. if one is available near you!

### Device Guidelines

[![Device GuideLines(content/device.png)](content/device.png)

To thrive in the program, **you need access to a computer**. This can be a good desktop or laptop with good battery life.

It will be almost impossible to do tech work exclusively from a mobile phone. The same is true for this program. **We do not support the course experience on a phone.**

While it’s true that you could access a lot of the course content via your mobile phone, you do need a computer to be able to complete all of the activities. This becomes especially true when you need to complete your Milestones and peer evaluations.

**Here are a few reasons why you definitely need a computer to successfully complete this program:**

+ 1 When you are working with Google Workspace on documents, spreadsheets, and presentations, you need a larger screen to be able to see and work skillfully with the large amount of data that is there.
+ 2 Most Milestones require you to create documents, convert them to .pdf, and upload them to Savanna. Converting documents on a phone is challenging, and we cannot guarantee that Savanna will successfully and consistently accept documents uploaded from a phone.
+ 3 The Weekly Tests are timed and the functionality of tests delivered on the phone is poor and sometimes non-functional, and taking a test on your phone can cause you to fail it.

The only place where mobile is an okay choice is when using the community messaging platform on The Room Portal.

>
> #### TLDR:
> You will need to use a computer to successfully complete the activities on Savanna and Google Workspace. We do not provide support for issues caused by attempting to take the course on a mobile device.
>

### Google Workspace

[![Device GuideLines(content/google.png)](content/google.png)

#### Google Workspace tools will also be your playground for the rest of this course.

If you don’t already have a Gmail account – which also serves as your Google Workspace account – now is the time to create one.

**Gmail for personal use is free** and allows you to access critical workspace tools including Drive, Sheets, Docs, Slides, Calendar, Google Meet, etc.

You can follow the step-by-step instructions here: <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en" target="_blank">How to create a Google account.</a> A personal account is free and should be sufficient for your purposes for now. A business account has more features but costs money each month. You can always upgrade later should you choose to.

#### We have a few more thoughts before you get started with creating your Gmail account.

You will likely be using your Gmail to connect with potential employers through emails, file sharing and online meetings, so think carefully about your username as it forms part of your email address (and personal brand to the outside world).

We recommend using your name as your Gmail username. For example, if your name is Sarati Jonas then your username should be something like Sarati.Jonas or sjonas. If those usernames are taken Gmail will suggest suitable alternatives. Pick one that is professional.

Using nicknames or pet names such as Sarababy, SJ4life or BigMuscleS21, will not demonstrate your professionalism. So think ahead a pick a username that will work well for you in professional settings. It will likely be the first impression you make when connecting with potential employers (or clients) via email.
