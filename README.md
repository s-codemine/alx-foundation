## Why Complete the ALX Professional Foundations Program?

A key driver and motivator that propels people to achieve the unachievable, set new norms, break limits and successfully Do Hard Things is understanding the **WHY**.

### WHY Do We Require This Course (When maybe all you really want is to learn tech skills)?
Employers from across the globe are consistently frustrated with entry-level employees because they commonly lack essential 21st-century skills. Specifically, many people lack the ability to think critically and creatively to solve complex problems, to communicate both in writing and speaking, to manage themselves and their time, and to successfully collaborate with diverse team members to complete projects.

The ALX Professional Foundations course is designed to give you a strong advantage by providing you with “The ALX Special Sauce”– a curated combination of meaningful opportunities to learn, practice, and deepen the knowledge, skill sets, and character qualities that are highly desired by employers, but that are not taught in most tech training programs.

Our Special Sauce consists of the 8 Meta Skills that we listed in our welcome note and will share more about it shortly. We invite you to learn more about the WHY behind these meta-skills. They are discussed in more depth in this <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/defining-the-skills-citizens-will-need-in-the-future-world-of-work?cid=other-soc-lkn-mps-mck-oth-2106--&amp;sid=8452174334&amp;linkId=194255334">research article by McKinsey</a>, which shares what is truly needed to thrive in the future, ever-changing world of work. Let’s pause here, so you can read the article. It will help you get to realize just how important this course is for your future success!
