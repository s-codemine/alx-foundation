## The Ideal ALX Graduate

Let’s get more specific. As an ALX graduate, not only do we expect you to build a set of character traits and values that are essential for any leader, but we also expect you to use these as the foundation for the rest of your career and your life.

To understand what we mean by this, you can think about a tree.

[![A Tree](content/tree.png)](content/tree.png)

Every tree has four main parts:

+ **The roots**, which keep the tree grounded and act as a source of water/life
+ **The trunk**, which connects the roots to the rest of the tree and acts as a sturdy foundation
+ **The branches**, which allow the tree to grow, flourish and bear fruit
+ **The leaves**, which show that the tree is healthy and thriving

This tree symbolizes you as an individual:

- Your roots are your **values and character**, which keep you stable and firmly planted
- Your trunk is your **foundational soft and hard skills**, which act as your central base and allow for your branches to grow
- Your branches are your **specialized skill sets**, which allow you to expand your reach and your impact
- Your leaves are your **experiences**, which demonstrate the lessons you’ve learned and the growth you have attained over many years

## Your Core Values Experiential

Here’s a fun and self reflective exercise that you’ll be a part of this Karibu ceremony. Let’s take a sneak peek to see what we’re getting into.

## The Ideal ALX Graduate Continued...

Without roots and a trunk, storms may blow your tree down. Storms can be in the form of challenging life events (e.g. family members passing, getting fired from a job). If your roots and trunk are strong, you can easily grow again regardless of the weather.


On the other hand, without branches and leaves, you would never be able to attract others towards you or share what you have with the rest of your community. With branches and leaves, you can grow to become expansive, and even assist other trees in growing as well.

An ideal ALX graduate recognizes that all parts of their tree are essential to being a change-making leader in the world!
